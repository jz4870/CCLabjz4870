                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Julia Zarzecka, March 2024</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Cosmic Cows have been discovered to be the source of all life on earth. They are the descendants of the Holy Cows of the Heavens. Cosmic Cows have also seeded life in other galaxies such as the Andromeda or the Comet galaxies. As they have seeded the whole life in the universe, we are all part of the Cosmic Cow family.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Cosmic Cows inhabit millions of different planets in the universe. They even appear on meteors as their mission is to gift life to every rock in space. Cosmic Cows are renowed for their ability to adapt to extreme conditions thanks to their ground breaking technology and millions of years of evolution.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Cosmic Cows don't differ much from the cows that we see on earth. Nevertheless, their black stains are perfectly symmetric as they represent the dychotomy and the balance of good and evil in the universe.</p>

               For thousands of years people were wondering about where life has come from to earth. Today we know that Cosmic Cows are our 'Mothers'. In many countries, cows are considerd to be the 'holy' animals, however their significance is far more important than what many have assumed up till this point. Cosmic Cows come from another dimension, have crtystalline bodies, live off of the cosmic energy and give life to all the living creatures in the universe.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Cosmic Cows have mastered the genetic modification technology, space travel and cloning. Now if they want to bring life to a planet or a meteor, they fly their spaceship and 'seed' their clones onto the new territories.
