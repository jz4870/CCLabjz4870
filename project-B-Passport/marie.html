    <h2>Marie Sk≈Çodowska Curie, a pioneering physicist and chemist, is renowned for her groundbreaking discoveries in radioactivity. Born in Poland in 1867, Curie, along with her husband Pierre Curie, isolated the element polonium in 1898 from pitchblende, a uranium-rich ore. Through meticulous chemical separation and analysis, they identified this highly radioactive element, naming it after Marie's homeland. This achievement not only expanded the periodic table but also laid the groundwork for future research in nuclear physics and medicine. Discover Polonium yourself on the right!</h2>
